# -GraphGen-
Graph and Tree Generation for Java-Based Algorithms

This tool is used to faciliate auto-generating graphs that you can traverse for common search algorithms and tree/graph based algorithms. 

Read in file in following structure:

```
1 -> 2, 3, 4
2 -> 5, 6
3 -> 7, 8
4 -> 9, 10
``` 

The generator will in turn create a traversable `Graph` structure that formulates the following:
